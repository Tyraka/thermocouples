* About
Thermocouples are used to measure temperature and have a very big range. They use voltage diffrences to determine the temperature.
* Chip - MAX 6675
** Specifications
| Suply Voltage          | 3.3 to 5 VDC       |
| Operating Current      | ~50mA              |
| Measurement Range      | 0 - 1024^∘C        |
| Measurement Resolution | +/- 0.25^∘C        |
| Output                 | Uses SPI interface |
| Required sensor        | K Thermocouple     |
** Pins functions: 
   - SO: Serial output, arduino reads output from this
   - CS: Chip select. Setting low, selects the Module and tells it to supply an output that is synchronize with a clock
   - SCK: input from arduino(serial clock)
   - VCC: power suply(5V)
   - GND: ground
   - -(minus): K Thermocouple minus input
   - +(plus): K Thermocouple plus input
